<!--REST: Hypertext Transfer Protocol --HTTP: doesn't 
    define how an application should be architected; this 
    means HTTP is used, and applications are designed 
    inconsitently across different companies; Roy Fielding: 
    Representational State Transfer: REST is not a protocol
    or HTTP, but it is the way we should use HTTP to 
    create an application, and it focuses on transferring 
    the state of a resource from one machine to another: from
    a front end application to a back end application sending 
    the state that represents the resource at that given moment
    in time from one machine to another; when we transfer the 
    state of a resource, we have multiple choices to represent
    the state: plain text, xml, json, or something else;

    JSON: JavaScript Object Notation: preferred way for most 
    developers to transfer the state of a resource: key-value
    pairs where properties of a resource have values assigned
    that represent the state of that entity at a given point 
    in time; -->

    } <!--this is the representation of the state of an 
    account resource at a specific time; the state will 
    always be changing; fronteend can send new state to 
    the backend or the backend could update and send the 
    new state to the backend -->

    <!--HTTP: Create - Post, Read - Get, Update - Update
    Delete - Delete; when we send a post request we expect
    a resource to be created; get will read a resource, update
    will update the resource, and delete will delete the 
    resource; get requests are typically requests for data and
    don't require a payload; payload is a text - typically 
    JSON - describing what we want the request to do; 
    post and update will have payloads that tell what to 
    create; update would tell what needs to be updated;
    a delete typically doesn't need a payload -->

    <!--Fetch: allows us to send an HTTP request and returns
    a promise that we handle based on the response data; built
in as part of JS as the global window object and we call it 
virtually anywhere from within a browser; Fetch takes one or two parameters: the url to 
send an HTTP request to; the second is an object used to 
initialize further details about that request: request body(
data we send in a request), a specific verb method, content type,
etc.   -->
