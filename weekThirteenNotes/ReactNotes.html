    <!--React Components: Each component should 
        represent a visual combination of HTML that can be reused; components
        can be thought of as custom HTML elements that we create, write custom
        functionality for, and reuse them repeatedly like a normal HTML element; 
        react lets us create our interfaces using a component-based architecture.
