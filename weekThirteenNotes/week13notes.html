   <!-- ReactJS is a JS library for building user 
    interfaces; used for Front end userfaces; easily 
    organize user interface into individual components 
    that we use wherever the UI needs them; organized by 
    visually logical segments; provides a virtual DOM when
     we mess with the DOM we did it at the risk of 
     application efficiency b/c small changes affect 
     larger parts of the DOM being rerendered instead of 
     just the part that was changed; Racts virtual DOM is 
     a lightweight representation of the DOM that checks 
     for differences in it, rather than the real DOM and 
     then only rerenders those elements and subset pieces 
     that changed with React; this makes our UI more 
     performant -->

     <!--Webpack allows us to import dependencies from specific 
        files into other files; webpack bundles all of our resources 
        into a single resource file; all JS files become one file to 
    be served to the user and that one file is all that needs to
be linked to a single HTML file that is bundles from all the other HTML files; this allows us to manage and write our code in separate files but link it all together in a bundle in one place-->
